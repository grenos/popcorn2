//! TODO

moviesByGenre state is an object with arrays inside
every named array inside corresponds to each genre category

calls for movies by category have their own reducer
which has one action and inside has a switch 
that watches what category was clicked and saves the returned data inside that category of the state

then on genres page we get all the movies by genre from state 
use a switch OR useReducer hook to see 
if location.pathname is EQUAL to category on state  (MAYBE ALSO DOABLE WITH FILTER)
we pass only that array to be rendered

so going back and forth with the browser 
everytime we hit a genre page we will get the right data to display
